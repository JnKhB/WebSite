<h1>What is skiing?</h1>

<p><strong>Alpine skiing</strong> is the sport of sliding down snow-covered hills on skis with fixed-heel bindings. It is also commonly known as downhill skiing, although that also incorporates different styles.</p>
<p>Alpine skiing began as a club sport in 1861 at Kiandra in Australia and a number of similar clubs in North America and the Swiss Alps. Today, most alpine skiing occurs at a ski resort with ski lifts that transport skiers up the mountain. The snow is groomed, avalanches are controlled and trees are cut to create trails. Many resorts also include snow making equipment to provide skiing when the weather would otherwise not allow it. Alternatively, alpine skiers may pursue the sport in less controlled environments; this practice is variously referred to as ski touring, backcountry skiing, or extreme skiing.</p>
<p>Skiing is an expensive sport, usually more expensive than a holiday on the beach. Every country's state put a lot of money into maintaining ski slopes and operating the ski lifst. That is the reason why skipasses are expensive. </p>
<p>The ski industry is particularly vulnerable to weather and <strong>climate risk</strong>. Operators are worried about climate change leading to warmer temperatures that reduce the duration of the ski season. But they’re also highly vulnerable to year-to-year variation in weather. </p>

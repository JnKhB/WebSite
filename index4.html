<h1>The beginning of a beautiful sport</h1>
<p>On this menu site you are able to read about the <strong>beginning of skiing</strong>.</p>

<h2>Rock carvings</h2>
<p>The earliest Scandinavian examples of skiing date to 3000 or 4000 <abbr title="Before Christian Era">BCE</abbr> with primitive carvings, presumably about the same age or slightly younger than the White Sea and Lake Onega carvings. An image of a skier holding a single pole or an ax with both hands, is found in Rødøy in the Nordland region of Norway. The Rødøy carving shows skis of equal length. A rock carving at Alta, Norway, from about 1000 or 500 <abbr title="Before Christian Era">BCE</abbr> depicts a skier seemingly about to shoot with bow and arrow, with skis positioned in an angle (rather than parallel) to offer good support.</p>
<h2>Ski samples</h2>
<p>The first primitive Scandinavian ski was found in a peat bog in Hoting in Jämtland County in Sweden which dates back to 4500 or 2500 <abbr title="Before Christian Era">BCE</abbr>. In 1938 a ski was found from Salla, Finland that has been dated back to 3245 <abbr title="Before Christian Era">BCE</abbr>. Noted examples are the Kalvträskskidan ski, found in Sweden and dated to 3300 <abbr title="Before Christian Era">BCE</abbr>, and the Vefsn Nordland ski, found in Norway and dated to 3200 <abbr title="Before Christian Era">BCE</abbr>.  There are some 20 findings of ancient, well-preserved skis in drained bogs in Norway, indicating that skis have been widely used in Norway, particularly Northern Norway, since prehistoric times.</p>

<h2>Skiing as transportation</h2>
<p>“Cross country skiing is great if you live in a small country,” was said by Steven Wright.  Skis were used by hunters in northern countries as they could easily follow prey through the deep snow.</p>
<h2>Skiing becomes a sport</h2>
<p>By the beginning of the 19th century, skiing caught on in the rest of Europe. While it did continue to serve its purpose as a mode of transportation, skiing became a form of recreation.  The world’s first ski club was formed in Austria and by 1868, mountain resorts became fashionable and accessible because people could travel to them by train.  The technological advances made with skis themselves, as well as with boots and bindings, made skiing a lot easier for the delicate masses.</p>

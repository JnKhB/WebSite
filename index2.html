<h1>Ski types</h1>
<h2>Recreational Skiing</h2>
<p>The majority of people who ski every year are recreational skiers. If you like to get out, ride the lifts and make a few turns at the local resort or on vacation a few times a year, you are a recreational skier. The whole idea when it comes to your skis is finding boards that make the experience more fun so that you can enjoy those precious days on the hill. You are in luck, recreational skier. New innovations in ski shapes and technology mean that it is far easier to ski than ever before.</p>
<p>If you have not skied in a long time, you will soon learn that skis these days are shorter and feature more aggressive sidecuts (the difference between the width of the ski at the tip and waist), making it far easier to turn them. Recreational skis are built mostly to handle groomed runs, but that doesn’t mean you can’t push yourself and learn to ski bumps, trees and even powder on a good pair of recreational boards. Furthermore, rentals and demos have improved as well, making it easier for you to try out quality equipment at the resort to make a better decision about what ski is right for you. </p>

<h2>Freestyle Skiing</h2>
<p>Freestyle Skiing is a form of skiing which originally encompassed two disciplines: aerials, and moguls. Besides those freestyle skiing now consists of skicross, half-pipe and slope style. <strong>Freeskiing</strong> is an Olympic discipline which shares characteristics with street skateboarding, BMX, and inline skating.</p>
<p>Currently there are two main branches of freestyle skiing: one encompassing the more traditional events of moguls and aerials, and a newer branch often called new school, comprising events such as halfpipe, big air, slopestyle, and big mountain or free-skiing. New school skiing has grown so much that new ski companies were created, companies that strictly make twin-tip skis — skis that are designed for taking off and landing “fakie”, or “switch” (backwards) on jumps and rails.</p>

<h2>Cross-country Skiing</h2>
<p>Rather than using lifts, <strong>cross-country skiers</strong> ski up the mountains themselves! They don’t ski down mountains as steep as the ones in downhill skiing. Cross-country skiing is much more aerobically demanding and it’s cheaper as you don’t have to pay for lift passes. Cross-country skiing uses a soft boot rather than the hard ones used in downhill, and the heel is not attached to the ski. The skis are lightweight and designed for self-propelled travel over a variety of terrain, not just down hills.</p>

<h2>Alpine Skiing</h2>
<p><strong>Alpine skiing</strong>, skiing technique that evolved during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the mountainous terrain of the Alps in central Europe.  Alpine skiing, or downhill skiing, is the pastime of sliding down snow-covered slopes on skis with fixed-heel bindings, unlike other types of skiing which use skis with free-heel bindings. Whether for recreation or for sport, it is typically practised at ski resorts, which provide such services as ski lifts, artificial snow making, snow grooming, restaurants, and ski patrol.</p>
